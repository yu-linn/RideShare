## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: 16 November 2016, 8pm
 * Where: Online via Slack

## Process - Reflection


Note that we have labelled this bullet points in order of importance.

Decisions turned out well:
- The front end mock-ups helped give us a clear template to easily design our front end system
- The CRC cards helped design and guide the backend
- The database design helped us decide which properties/attributes were actually relevant and necessary
- Using gitignore files for the Android Studio generated files


Decisions did not turn out as well as you hoped:
- Trello wasn't used at all for a while, but we have adapted to it recently
- Since we planned to use persistant data for the backend, the backend is disconnected from the frontend


We are planning to make the following changes to our process:
- Using Trello more to keep track of which members are doing which tasks
- Clearer communication between individuals so we know what everyone is working on, and reduce overlap between two people's work



## Product - Review

Goals/tasks that were met/completed:
- Design a database for the application
- Start implementing our UI design into the project, expected that this will change a lot still so best to keep it flexible.
- Creating front end for event creation, profile, login / signup, home page, event screens
- Creating the backend classes and system for our front end
- Screen transitions and logic 
- Design schema and tables for database structure


Goals/tasks that were planned but not met/completed:
- Implement a database for the application
- Experiment using APIs in the application (Example, test out google maps to plan routes for drivers) and see what works well enough to integrate into our project.
- Using noSQL (MongoDB)
- Everything on the if time allows list


Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:
- Linking front-end with back-end
- Using MongoDB and Kinvey
- Front end polish and dynamic content generation from database (instead of hardcoded)
